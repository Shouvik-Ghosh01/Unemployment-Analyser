# Unemployment Analysis with Python

This project analyzes unemployment data for various regions in India. The goal is to understand the factors that contribute to unemployment and its patterns over time.

Python Libraries

pandas
numpy
matplotlib.pyplot
seaborn
plotly.express
Data

The data used in this project is a sample dataset containing the estimated unemployment rate, estimated employed population, and estimated labor participation rate for each region over a period.

Data Exploration

Loading and Cleaning Data: The data is loaded using pandas and cleaned to ensure consistency.
Exploratory Data Analysis: The data is analyzed to understand the distribution of unemployment rates across different regions.
Correlation Analysis: The correlation between unemployment rate and other factors like estimated employed population and estimated labor participation rate is investigated.
Visualization

Heatmap: A heatmap is created to visualize the correlation between different features.
Histogram: Histograms are plotted to visualize the distribution of unemployment rates and employed population across different regions.
Sunburst Chart: A Sunburst chart is created to visualize the unemployment rate for each state within a region.
Next Steps

Feature Engineering: Create new features that might be relevant to unemployment analysis.
Time Series Analysis: Analyze unemployment trends over time.
Machine Learning: Develop a model to predict unemployment rates.
